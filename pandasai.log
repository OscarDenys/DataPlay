<function>
def execute_sql_query(sql_query: str) -> pd.Dataframe
    """This method connects to the database, executes the sql query and returns the dataframe"""
</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 show me the first five rows, and delete all the other data

You generated this python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = 'SELECT * FROM table_642e816fe91c058e7c6fb389bb1fcf66 LIMIT 5'
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)

execute_sql_query(sql_query_delete)
result = {'type': 'dataframe', 'value': df}
print(result)

Fix the python code above and return the new python code but the code generated should use execute_sql_query function

 delete the first name column

You generated this python code:

</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 delete the first name column

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 create a histogram that shows the top ten performers

You generated this python code:
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sql_query = 'SELECT * FROM table_74ee0b9b490875dd0390493ab8b0cee3 ORDER BY Final_Grade DESC LIMIT 10'
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(df['username'], df['Final_Grade'], color='blue')
plt.title('Top Ten Performers')
plt.xlabel('Username')
plt.ylabel('Final Grade')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('exports/charts/temp_chart.png')
result = {'type': 'plot', 'value': 'exports/charts/temp_chart.png'}

Fix the python code above and return the new python code but the code generated should use execute_sql_query function

<function>
def execute_sql_query(sql_query: str) -> pd.Dataframe
    """This method connects to the database, executes the sql query and returns the dataframe"""
</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 create a histogram


At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:
